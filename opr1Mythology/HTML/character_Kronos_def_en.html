One of the 12 Titans. Kronos is depicted as either a vigorous male, tall and powerful, or as an old bearded man
Kronos is the son of Ouranus and Gaia. He is married to Rhea, who is also a Titan. She had a temple on the Greek island of Crete at Phaistos, an ancient Minoan site. Their children are​ Hera, Hestia, Demeter, Hades, Poseidon, and Zeus. In addition, Aphrodite was born from his severed member, which Zeus threw into the sea. None of his children were particularly close to him—Zeus had the most interaction with him, but even then, that was only to castrate Kronos, just as Kronos himself had done to his own father, Uranus.
